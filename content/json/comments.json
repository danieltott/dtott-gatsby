You know what you are doing with CSS, there is no reason to revert to something like SASS which esentially attempts to make CSS a pseudo programming language - which it isn&#8217;t and was never meant to be.

The various IE6 PNGfixes, like Angus&#8217;, kill &#8216;background-position&#8217; values, which in turn kill the ability to use a single image.</p><p>I never did get around to writing up how I did my solution.  Maybe we should do it jointly.  I think a useful update would be to use CSS hacks (or a conditionally commented IE6-only stylesheet) to feed the sliced-up and fixed PNGs to IE6, while letting everyone else use a single PNG.</p><p>Of course, if IE8 supports rounded corners, the impetus for using this kind of solution will diminish, but it could still be very useful for the next couple of years.</p><p>So whaddya think?  Should we write it up, maybe submit it to A List Apart?</p>",

One nice thing about going the direction you suggested is that we could use that chance to apply the css filter (for PNG-type transparency) manually, and throw out the script. I&#8217;ve already noticed delays running that script through each corner in ie6, so maybe that&#8217;d be the way to go.  It also would make me feel a lot better to have just one image loading normally. </p><p>Anyway, maybe drop me an email (dan at this site) and we can talk about things some more.</p>",
