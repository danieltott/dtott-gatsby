  Well, I made it almost a month since the last design change. However, this
  redesign is a little more extensive.

<h3>The Little Stuff</h3>
<p>
  First, I went to an all-Helvetica font scheme. My typography was all over the
  place on the last view versions, and I feel much more comfortable with
  choosing one font and sticking to it. Second, but related, I moved the title
  and navigation to their own bar under the opening graphic, and moved the
  quotes under the section heads to the right of the section heads.
</p>
<h3>The Grid</h3>
<p>
  The next thing I needed to change was the vertical spacing. I chose 1.5 ems as
  my baseline height, and went with it. Everything now lies on a 1.5 em baseline
  grid. You can imagine (or maybe you know from experience) that this seems like
  it could be a pain. It is. What was my secret weapon?{' '}

  . What it does is place a horizontal grid over the page you're viewing, at any
  size you'd like. 1em converts to 16px, so I was able to line everything up to
  a 24px horizontal grid. It's awesome.
</p>
<h3>The Em</h3>
<p>
  The biggest change, which might not be all that visible at first, is that the
  entire site (except for a couple borders) is now in ems. The entire structure,
  the images, and of course the fonts, now resize with the text. The effect is
  that when you increase font size in your browser, the entire web site zooms.
  Try it out (cmd/apple + to increase size, cmd/apple - to lower size).
</p>

<p>
  Seems like an easy concept; just divide all of your pixel values by 16, like I
  mentioned before, and you're set, right? Well, at first, yes. For the overall
  structure, that's all I had to do. The problems arise when you change the font
  size of an element. Whenever you change the font size of an element, like a
  paragraph or a heading, the rest of the attributes of that element are
  measured against the new font size, instead of the body font size. To get the
  margin or padding that you want, you have to divide the margin you'd like by
  the new font size, and that number is your new margin.{' '}
  <strong>Ideal margin / new font size = New margin</strong>.

<p>I had my calculator program running the entire time.</p>

  It's been a fun (and trying) experiment. Hopefully this version will last
  longer than a month before I'm fed up with it!
