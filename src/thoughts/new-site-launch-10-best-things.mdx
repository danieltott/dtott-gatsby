[10bestthings.com](http://10bestthings.com) just went live a few minutes ago. It's basically a site where you can make top 10 (or any number, really) lists and then share them around. It's actually a lot of fun to play with. Here's a list I made a while ago that I'm fairly proud of: [My favorite Christmas movies](http://www.10bestthings.com/list/52) .

This was a [Sprokets](http://sprokets.net) project, meaning that I was responsible for the HTML/CSS/Javascript, and was blessed to work with the extremely talented likes of [Vince Frantz](http://frantzid.com), [John-Paul Walton](http://schemestudio.com), [Brad Colbow](http://colbowdesign.com), [Mike Barone](http://www.nontoxicgroup.com/), and [Matt Grosse](http://www.mattgrosse.com). It was a pleasure, as always.

Congrats to the Sprokets crew, and good job everyone.

So what are you waiting for? Go [make a list](http://10bestthings.com)!
