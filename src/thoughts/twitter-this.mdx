  <p>So most everyone I know in the community is a <a href="http&#58;//twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> user, but I've managed to avoid it up to this point.  However, seeing as I have absolutely nothing to do today, <a href="https&#58;//twitter.com/danieltott" title="My Twitter Page">I joined Twitter</a>.  I'm hoping it will give me a chance to say things that are too inconsequential for a full-on blog post, but that I still want people to hear.  Up till now, I was using <a href="http&#58;//sprokets.net" title="Sprokets">Sprokets</a>' <a href="http&#58;//www.campfirenow.com/" title="37 Signal's Campfire">campfire</a> room for that purpose.  I'll probably keep doing that, but, you know, Twitter is cool, too.</p>

<p>So most everyone I know in the community is a <a href="http://twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> user, but I've managed to avoid it up to this point.

<p>That being said, I'm a total n00b when it comes to Twitter.   I'm aware of <a href="http://snook.ca/snitter/" title="Snitter">Snitter</a> and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific" title="Twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>, but are there other Twitter clients out there?  Which one do you use/which one is best?  Also, are there any people out there that I really should add to my "follow" list?  </p>
<p>How about terminology?  Have I already embarrassed myself by not using the in-lingo when referring to different parts of Twitter?  <a href="http://braddielman.com" title="Brad Dielman">Brad</a> just "nudged" me; I'm not even sure what that means.  Is that like first base?  </p>
<p>Well, either way, I'm looking forward to trying it out.  We'll see what happens.</p>
