So most everyone I know in the community is a [Twitter](http://twitter.com 'Twitter') user, but I've managed to avoid it up to this point. However, seeing as I have absolutely nothing to do today, [I joined Twitter](https://twitter.com/danieltott 'My Twitter Page') . I'm hoping it will give me a chance to say things that are too inconsequential for a full-on blog post, but that I still want people to hear. Up till now, I was using [Sprokets](http://sprokets.net 'Sprokets') ' [campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/ "37 Signal's Campfire") room for that purpose. I'll probably keep doing that, but, you know, Twitter is cool, too.

That being said, I'm a total n00b when it comes to Twitter. I'm aware of [Snitter](http://snook.ca/snitter/ 'Snitter') and [Twitterrific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific 'Twitterrific') , but are there other Twitter clients out there? Which one do you use/which one is best? Also, are there any people out there that I really should add to my "follow" list?

How about terminology? Have I already embarrassed myself by not using the in-lingo when referring to different parts of Twitter? [Brad](http://braddielman.com 'Brad Dielman') just "nudged" me; I'm not even sure what that means. Is that like first base?

Well, either way, I'm looking forward to trying it out. We'll see what happens.
