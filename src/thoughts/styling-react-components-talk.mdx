  You can{' '}
  <a href="https://clereact-styling-react-components-slides.netlify.com/">
    view the slides on Netlify
  </a>
  , and the{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/danieltott/styling-react-components-slides">
    source code over on Github
  </a>
  . I used a package called{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck">mdx-deck</a> which was an awesome
  experience. mxd-deck allows you to code a slide deck using{' '}
  <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>, which is a combination of Markdown and
  JSX. It uses Gatsby behind the scenes, which means it builds out as a static
  site that can be easily hosted on Netlify!
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  In the talk, I examined styling components using the <code>style</code> prop,
  different ways of using real CSS, and then a couple different CSS-in-JS
  approaches, including{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS Modules</a> and{' '}
  <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The code examples are also{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/danieltott/Styling-React-Components">
    up on Github
  </a>
  . Each one has it's own build on Netlify and can be toyed with on CodeSandbox.
  The modern internet is pretty cool.
