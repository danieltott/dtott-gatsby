It's been a very busy summer. Between [buying a house](http://flickr.com/photos/dtott/sets/72157605640047678/ 'My house pictures on flickr') , moving into said house, [getting married](http://flickr.com/photos/ehiddy/sets/72157606817768795/ "Wedding pictures on Emily's flickr page") , [vacationing](http://flickr.com/photos/ehiddy/sets/72157606770646008/ "Our vacation photos on Emily's flickr page") , and somehow managing to work, I haven't had any time for the website. But I'm finally caught up with (most) everything, so I thought it was time to get back to the blog.

Everything this summer went really well. Emily and I are both happy with the house, and being married ain't half bad. It is good to get back to everything, though.

While this post might not be of very much use to you, I thought I'd drop a line, and let you know I've got some articles coming down the pipeline for you, plus I'll be joining a [handful](http://shallowthoughts.org/ 'Bridget Stewart') [of](http://resistmedia.net/blog/ 'Beth Dean (hopefully)') [good](http://www.colbowdesign.com/ 'Brad Colbow') [people](http://braddielman.com/ 'Brad Dielman') at [<abbr title="An Event Apart">AEA Chicago</abbr>](http://www.aneventapart.com/events/2008/chicago/), and I'm sure I'll have some something to say about that, as well. So stay tuned, and I'll see you soon.
