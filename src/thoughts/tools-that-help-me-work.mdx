      I have a lot of articles "in the pipes," but I've been finding it hard to
      get into the rhythm of writing again, so I thought I'd start with an easy
      post to get the juices flowing. This sort of post is obviously something
      plenty of people have done before, but I usually find them interesting.
      Since it's been done before, I thought I would concentrate on some of the
      smaller things that make my life better/easier, instead of the normal
      operating system (OS X Leopard)/text editor (Coda) writeup.

<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.versionsapp.com/" title="Versions' Website">
    Versions
  </a>{' '}
  is a Mac SVN client that works very, very well. I had been using{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/features/"
    title="svnX Subversion Client"
  >
    svnX
  </a>
  , which never really gave me any problems, but after using Versions for about
  a day, you wouldn't really be able to convince me to go back. Versions has the
  polish that Mac users have come to expect, both visually, and
  interaction-wise. I'm able to group all of my repositories in different
  folders, and working copies show up under their respective repository. All in
  all, a very nice app that I take for granted now because it works so well.
</p>
<h3>TextExpander</h3>
<p>
  Most text editors these days have the idea of "clips," or something similar,
  in which you build a library of code snippets, and them access them in
  different ways. What{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/"
    title="TextExpander by SmileonmyMac"
  >
    TextExpander
  </a>{' '}
  does is take that functionality and build it into the operating system, so
  that you can just type a certain code word, and it automatically replaces it
  with the given text.
</p>
<p>
  This is not only useful for work (I type "rreset" to have it spit out Meyer's
  CSS reset), but also for normal, everyday typing. I have my address saved, so
  that if I type the numbers from my address, it replaces it with the whole
  thing. Same with city ("bll" becomes "Bloomington"), email, lots of things. I
  use it without thinking, and every time I type the same thing more than a few
  times, it goes into textExpander. It keeps track of the time it saves you, and
  I'm over two hours now. Two hours is a lot of typing.

<h3>Billings</h3>
<p>
  Any freelancer needs to have a setup that they're completely comfortable with
  for tracking time, creating/sending invoices, and tracking
  clients/payments/etc. There are tons of great tools out there, and I've used a
  number of them. Up until about a month ago, I had been using{' '}
  <a href="http://www.officetime.net/" title="OfficeTime">
    OfficeTime
  </a>{' '}
  for time tracking and invoice creating, and a plain spreadsheet for tracking
  client payments.
</p>
<p>
  A month or two ago, I found{' '}
  <a href="http://www.billingsapp.com/index.html" title="Billings 3">
    Billings 3
  </a>
  , and tried it out. Like Versions, Billings is a much nicer app to work with
  than OfficeTime, which attracted me from the beginning. However, Billings is a
  much more comprehensive tool for organizing your business than officeTime is.
  I need to try hard to be organized, so anything that helps me do that is a
  plus. Billings makes staying on top of the business end of things much easier
  on me. I can track estimates, time, clients, payments, personal projects, and
  a lot of other things, all in one place.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  Billing's invoice/estimate templating engine is also very extensive. I've been
  finding it a little difficult to get into it to build custom templates from
  scratch, but changing small things on one of their many built-in templates is
  pretty straight forward, and creates nice-looking results. They also export
  into pdfs, instead of rtfd's (which is what OfficeTime used). All in all a
  great tool that has already helped me be more comfortable keeping track of
  things.
</p>
<h3>Evernote</h3>
<p>
  Put{' '}
  <a href="http://evernote.com/" title="Evernote">
    Evernote
  </a>{' '}
  into the "tools that help dan stay organized" pile. Their slogan is "Remember
  everything," which is nice for me, because my unofficial slogan is "I forget
  everything." I use Evernote constantly. I keep article ideas, work notes,
  javascript tricks i'd like to try sometime, and lots of other stuff in there.
  It searches instantly, and can capture all sorts of stuff. I've been using it
  for a couple months now, and have over a 100 notes stored, mostly
  work-related. Also, like most of the other apps on this list, it has that nice
  Mac "feel" to it.
</p>
<p>
  Evernote is also useful because it has an iPhone companion app that syncs with
  your desktop account, so I can take a quick note when I'm away from my
  computer, and then file it when I get home.
</p>
<h3>Firebug</h3>
<p>
  If I had to get rid of every app that I use in my business but one, I would
  keep <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>. I can't even begin to
  estimate how much time Firebug has saved me while developing websites, and
  there really isn't anything that compares. I could write a whole article on
  it, but I'm just going to leave it at this: if you build websites, you should
  be using firebug.
