<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1247641433223376898">tweet from Eric Meyer</a> invited us to revive the tradition of <a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">CSS Naked Day</a>!</p>
<p>From the site's description:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good old play on words. It's time to show off your <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for what it really is.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've participated a <a href="http://cms.dtott.test/thoughts/2008/04/09/naked-is-as-naked-does">few</a> <a href="http://cms.dtott.test/thoughts/2009/04/08/it-s-naked-time-again">times</a> over the years, and it feels really good to be participating again.</p>
<p>This site is <a href="http://cms.dtott.test/thoughts/2018/08/20/gatsby-craft-cms-the-promised-land">built using React and Gatsby</a> - but that doesn't mean it isn't build using solid and accessible markup!</p>
<p>For future reference, <a href="/images/css-naked-day-2020-screenshot.png">here's a screenshot of the site</a> in it's naked form.</p>
