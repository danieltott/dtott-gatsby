A [tweet from Eric Meyer](https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1247641433223376898) invited us to revive the tradition of [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/)!

From the site's description:

> The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good old play on words. It's time to show off your `<body>` for what it really is.

I've participated a [few](/thoughts/2008/04/09/naked-is-as-naked-does) [times](/thoughts/2009/04/08/it-s-naked-time-again) over the years, and it feels really good to be participating again.

This site is [built using React and Gatsby](/thoughts/2018/08/20/gatsby-craft-cms-the-promised-land) - but that doesn't mean it isn't build using solid and accessible markup!

For future reference, [here's a screenshot of the site](/images/css-naked-day-2020-screenshot.png) in it's naked form.
