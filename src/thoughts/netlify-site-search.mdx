Having a site search can be handy for your users, but sort of a pain to get going, especially if you're using Gatsby or another JAMstack system.

Chris Coyer's [first recommendation for site search](https://css-tricks.com/on-site-search/) is to use DuckDuckGo (or Google if you must), using the `site:yoursite.com` keyword. The only problem is that it requires a bit of javascript to insert the `site:` keyword to the user's search after they hit submit.

If you're deploying to Netlify, you can accomplish this without adding any javascript by using [redirects with query parameters](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#query-parameters). The idea is we create a form with a specific query parameter, and then set up a redirect that watches for that parameter and sends the user to DuckDuckGo with the correct `site:` keyword appended.

Here's the html for the search form:

```html
<form action="/search" method="GET">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="term" aria-label="Search site" />
    <button type="submit">Go</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

Two important points here:

- Notice that `method` is set to `GET` - it's important that the form is using `GET` as opposed to `POST` so that the redirect can see the query parameter.
- We've set the `name` of the input to `term`. This can be anything, it just needs to be the same here as in the redirect rule below.

Once that's in place, there are two methods for adding a redirect on Netlify. From the docs:

> You can configure redirect and rewrite rules for your Netlify site in two ways:
>
> - Save a plain text file called `_redirects` to the [publish directory](/configure-builds/get-started/#basic-build-settings) of your site. You can find [`_redirects` file syntax](/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) details below.
> - Add one or more `redirects` tables to your [Netlify configuration file](/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#redirects). This method allows for more structured configuration and additional capabilities, as described in the [Netlify configuration file syntax](/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-netlify-configuration-file) section below.

This solution will work with either method. Here's what it will look like in `_redirects`:

```_redirects
/search term=:term https://duckduckgo.com/?q=:term+site:dtott.com
```

And here's what it will look like in your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/search"
  to = "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=:term+site:dtott.com" #replace dtott.com with your site url
  query = {term = ":term"}
```

Just be sure to replace `dtott.com` with your site url, and make sure the query parameter name matches the form (`term` in this case). And that's it! You can see this working below
