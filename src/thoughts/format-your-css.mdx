      For years, I've always formatted my CSS in what I like to think of as the
      "traditional" manner. Each selector on one line, and each property
      indented one tab underneath. But when I started working with{' '}
      <a href="http://sprokets.net" title="Sprokets">
        Sprokets
      </a>
      , the other front-end developer there was using one-line css declarations.
      This threw me for a loop for a while, but I slowly started liking it
      better and better.

export const tags = ['front end', 'css']

export const meta = {
  title: 'Format Your CSS',

  For years, I've always formatted my CSS in what I like to think of as the
  "traditional" manner. Each selector on one line, and each property indented
  one tab underneath:
</p>

```css
#content {
  width: 49em;
  padding: 0 1.5em;
  margin: 0 auto;
  clear: both;
}
#content h2 {
  font-size: 2em;
  height: 1.5em;
  margin-left: 0.75em;
  color: #000;
}
#content h2 a {
  font-weight: normal;
  float: left;
}
#content h3 {
  font-size: 1.25em;
  line-height: 1.2em;
  color: #4d9fdd;
}
```

  Pretty standard stuff. I'd break up sections with big comments, and that made
  it fairly easy to scan. While this format never caused and problems{' '}
  <em>per se</em>, and it was easy enough to implement, it never seemed
  completely ideal.
</p>

  When I started working with{' '}
  <a href="http://sprokets.net" title="Sprokets">
    Sprokets
  </a>
  , the other front-end developer there was using one-line css declarations.
  This threw me for a loop for a while, but I slowly started liking it better
  and better.

  The method I've finally settled on is based on the one-line approach, but with
  an extra twist: I indent the declarations based on it's place in the HTML
  document. For example, take the HTML for this simple page:
</p>

```html
<div id="one">
  <p>text</p>
  <p>text</p>
</div>
<div id="two">
  <p>text</p>
  <ul>
    <li>list item</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

<p>The CSS to access this code would be like this:</p>

```css
body{ properties; }
  #one{ properties; }
    #one p{ properties; }
  #two{ properties; }
    #two p{ properties; }
    #two ul{ properties; }
      #two ul li{ properties; }
```

<p>
  This has worked very well for me so far, and I'm looking forward to trying out
  on some bigger projects. It allows me to scan through my CSS much more
  quickly, view comments more easily, and has the added benefit of helping me
  think through things like descendants and inheritance. Take a look at{' '}
  <a
    href="/thoughts/wp-content/themes/dtott/style.css"
    title="dtott.com stylesheet"
  >
    the CSS for this site
  </a>{' '}
  to see it in action on a bigger scale.
</p>
<p>
  This method, while new for me, is clearly{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/css-indention-method/"
    title="i.e. someone else did it a while ago"
  >
    not revolutionary
  </a>
  . However, since I stumbled on it on my own, I thought some of you guys might
  benefit from it as I have. How do you format your CSS?
