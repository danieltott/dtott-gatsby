So here's some good news. The guys over at CSS Off [recruited five judges](http://cssoff.com/2007/09/12/meet-the-css-off-judges/ 'Meet The CSS Off Judges - CSS Off') to help out, including yours truly.

I'm really excited for the chance to help out with this project. We have [a good group of people](http://cssoff.com/meet-the-css-off-judges/ 'Meet The CSS Off Judges') who are all active in CSS Off as well as the blogging community, so it'll be fun to put all of our heads together and read some code!

Ok so we're all probably huge nerds as well...but I've never been one to deny that about myself(:

Anyway, like I said before, the next contest starts at 12:01 am CST (1:01 am EST) on September 15\. That basically means twelve (one) in the morning on this Friday night. I'll see you all there!
