  I'm really excited for the chance to help out with this project. We have{' '}
  <a
    href="http://cssoff.com/meet-the-css-off-judges/"
    title="Meet The CSS Off Judges"
  >
    a good group of people
  </a>{' '}
  who are all active in CSS Off as well as the blogging community, so it'll be
  fun to put all of our heads together and read some code!{' '}

<p>
  Ok so we're all probably huge nerds as well...but I've never been one to deny
  that about myself(:

<p>
  Anyway, like I said before, the next contest starts at 12:01 am CST (1:01 am
  EST) on September 15. That basically means twelve (one) in the morning on this
  Friday night. I'll see you all there!
