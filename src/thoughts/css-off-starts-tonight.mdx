      The second round of <a href="http://cssoff.com">CSS OFF</a> starts tonight
      at midnight CST (which would be 1: 00 AM for us Clevelanders). If you
      didn't hear about it already, CSS OFF is a monthly contest to create the
      best single web page. They give you a .psd and 24 hours, and you have to
      come up with the best standards-based solution using images, css, and
      (x)html. I entered in the{' '}

      to a charity of your choice. The first winner,{' '}

      sure most will.
