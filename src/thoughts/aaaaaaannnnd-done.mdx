I've finally finished with my [cssoff entry](http://cssoff.com/2007/07/14/july-14-2007-earlybird/). I worked on it from 1am till about 8am, and then a couple hours this afternoon ironing out browser (read: Internet Explorer) bugs. I'm pretty happy with what I ended up with though.

It looks about the same in most browsers and it validates, so I'm happy. I even made a favicon!

For now, I'm kind of tired and haven't eaten since last night, so I'll post more on the process when I can see straight.
