One of the more popular posts on this site is [my explanation of the easyclear method](http://dtott.com/thoughts/2007/12/10/clear-your-floats-the-right-way/ 'Clear your floats: the right way') of clearing floats. I had been using it for a while when I wrote the post, and it's a great solution. However, [Dave Woods](http://www.dave-woods.co.uk/ 'Dave Woods') [commented](http://dtott.com/thoughts/2007/12/10/clear-your-floats-the-right-way/#comment-86 "Dave Woods' comment") on that post with a new method: setting `overflow:auto` on the containing element actually has the same effect as the clearfix, without all the extra stuff.

I thought, "that _can't_ be right...can it?" Turns out Dave was right. After looking into it some more, it turns out that `overflow:auto` and `overflow:hidden` both work the same way, and that's it.

```css
.containingElement {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Of course, <abbr title="Browser of Death">IE6</abbr> doesn't play along with the rest, so as always, here's the hack:

```css
* html #container {
  height: 1%;
}
```

Use this hack (or one without the `* html` inside an <abbr title="Browser voted most likely to cause suicide">ie6</abbr>-only stylesheet) to make <abbr title="Raise your hand if you hate ie6">ie6</abbr> behave correctly.

### That's all there is to it.

I have since began using it everywhere, and it works flawlessly. The only time it doesn't work correctly is when you actually need elements to overflow the box (a drop-down menu for example, or any absolutely positioned elements outside of the box). In these cases, I fall back on the trusty clearfix. But for all others, `overflow:hidden` to the rescue!
