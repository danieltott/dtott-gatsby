  I thought, "that <em>can't</em> be right...can it?" Turns out Dave was right.
  After looking into it some more, it turns out that <code>overflow:auto</code>{' '}
  and <code>overflow:hidden</code> both work the same way, and that's it.{' '}
</p>

```css
.containingElement {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

<p>
  Of course, <abbr title="Browser of Death">IE6</abbr> doesn't play along with
  the rest, so as always, here's the hack:
</p>

```css
* html #container {
  height: 1%;
}
```

<p>
  Use this hack (or one without the <code>* html</code> inside an{' '}
  <abbr title="Browser voted most likely to cause suicide">ie6</abbr>-only
  stylesheet) to make <abbr title="Raise your hand if you hate ie6">ie6</abbr>{' '}
  behave correctly.
</p>
<h3>That's all there is to it.</h3>
<p>
  I have since began using it everywhere, and it works flawlessly. The only time
  it doesn't work correctly is when you actually need elements to overflow the
  box (a drop-down menu for example, or any absolutely positioned elements
  outside of the box). In these cases, I fall back on the trusty clearfix. But
  for all others, <code>overflow:hidden</code> to the rescue!
