Yes, it's back. The annual [CSS Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/).

> The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your `<body>`.

It's good fun, and a good exercise. Enjoy naked time while it lasts!
