      It's been quiet around here for a few months. Part of that, of course, is
      the holidays and all the craziness that comes with them. But the main
      reason is that I've spent most of my free computer time on this&#58; my
      new site.

  It&#8217;s built on the mostly awesome but sometimes infuriating{' '}
  <a href="http://ExpressionEngine.com">ExpressionEngine</a>, and features some
  stuff that I&#8217;m fairly proud of:{' '}
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brand new design, by yours truly</li>
  <li>
    Javascript/CSS - based fluid layout (check out the{' '}
    <a href="http://dtott.com">home page</a> for the best example).
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="http://dtott.com/work">portfolio section</a> features some
    custom javascript if you&#8217;re in a decent browser. Safari, especially,
    will give you a treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some cool stuff like <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> and{' '}
    <a href="http://Modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> (and of course{' '}
    <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and{' '}
    <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI</a>)
  </li>
  <li>Some fun HTML5 and CSS3 stuff throughout</li>
</ul>

  I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://minchdesign.com">Craig Minch</a> for
  periodically guiding me in the right direction, and my wife Emily for being so
  awesome and being my Official Design Consultant on this project.

<p>
  I&#8217;ll most likely be posting about different aspects of the site; but
  please feel free to drop a comment if you&#8217;d like to know more about
  anything in particular.
</p>

<p>Take a look around, and enjoy(:</p>
