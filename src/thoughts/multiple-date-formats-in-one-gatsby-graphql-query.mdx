Using some special magic, Gatsby can [transform date fields in GraphQL queries into different formats](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/graphql-reference#format). But what if you would like more than one format, and don't want to import an entire library?

Here is the example the Gatsby docs use for `formatString`:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark(filter: { frontmatter: { date: { ne: null } } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
          date(formatString: "dddd DD MMMM YYYY")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

My problem was that I wanted a nicely formatted string, but also needed a valid `datetime` value for a [`<time>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) element. Turns out this is really easy in GraphQL queries, but does not turn up in searches (that I could find).

The solution is that you can use [field aliases](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases) to _repeat_ a field in the same query. This really applies to any field, but becomes especially useful for field transforms.

Here's the same query, but with two different date formats:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark(filter: { frontmatter: { date: { ne: null } } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
          relativeDate: date(fromNow: true)
          isoDate: date(formatString: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will result in an object with `frontmatter.relativeDate` and `frontmatter.isoDate`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allMarkdownRemark": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "frontmatter": {
              "title": "Break with a Banshee",
              "relativeDate": "28 years ago",
              "isoDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

I'm sure this is obvious to GraphQL pros, but it took me a while to figure this one out, so I wanted to share. Yay for learning!
