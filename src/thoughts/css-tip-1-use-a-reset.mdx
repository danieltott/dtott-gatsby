<h3>What's A Reset?</h3>
<p>
  A CSS reset is a set of CSS declarations designed to strip away all possible
  default formatting before adding any of your own. Every browser out there has
  default formatting for every HTML element. The body element in almost every
  browser has padding, margins, a set font size and color, and a set background
  color. Headings have margins, padding, different font sizes, and different
  font weights. Turn of CSS on your browser while viewing a site, and you'll see
  the default CSS that the browser uses. What the reset does, then, is strip all
  of that away. Headings, paragraphs, fieldsets, and everything else, set to one
  font, one size, one weight, and no extra paddings and margins.
</p>
<h3>But...Why?</h3>
<p>
  Well, there's a few reasons. First, by resetting the CSS, you remove the
  temptation to rely on browser defaults that may or may not be the same
  cross-browser. <code>H1</code>s, at least to the naked eye, are pretty
  consistent across the field. What about <code>fieldsets</code> or{' '}
  <code>dl</code>s?
</p>
<p>
  Second, removing that temptation will make you a better CSS coder. By having
  to explicitly set each attribute on each element you want to use, it forces
  you to learn what you might normally gloss over.
</p>
<p>
  Third, it will make your code meaner and cleaner. You won't have to set the
  margin and padding every time you use a <code>ul</code> unless the design
  calls for it. No more wasting lines and time undoing what the browser does for
  you.
</p>
<h3>OK, I'm Sold. What Now?</h3>
<p>
  Go out there and get a reset! If you are a control-freak-ninja-CSS-master, you
  could write your own, but there's no need for this.{' '}
