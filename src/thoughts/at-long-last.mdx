Finally, I'm live and on the scene. This is the forth or fifth incarnation of this website since I first registered the domain and started working on it. It was a challenge from the beginning, and I think that I succeeded in keeping it standard, accessible, and pretty.

### My intentions for this website:

1.  Keep an up-to-date [portfolio](/portfolio)
2.  Create and maintain a journal of technical articles, interesting links, and images that i create (if only there was some name for this..."web log" or something like that...)
3.  Excersize my standards, accessibility, and best practice skills
4.  Have fun doing it.

It should be a good, interesting time.
