  Aside from containing great information, it really is a pleasure to look at
  (check out those font stacks!). Two chapters are available right now:{' '}
  <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/detect.html">Detecting HTML5 Features</a>,
  which is really an in-depth explanation of how{' '}
  <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> works, and{' '}
  <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html">
    Letâ€™s Call It A Draw(ing Surface)
  </a>
  , which contains some good stuff on the <code>canvas</code> element.
</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that makes me want to work on my redesign(:</p>
