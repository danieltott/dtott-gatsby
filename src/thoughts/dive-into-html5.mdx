[Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/) is a thoroughly beautiful site by [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/) that houses text from his upcoming book of the same name.

Aside from containing great information, it really is a pleasure to look at (check out those font stacks!). Two chapters are available right now: [Detecting HTML5 Features](http://diveintohtml5.org/detect.html), which is really an in-depth explanation of how [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) works, and [Letâ€™s Call It A Draw(ing Surface)](http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html) , which contains some good stuff on the `canvas` element.

This is the sort of thing that makes me want to work on my redesign (:
