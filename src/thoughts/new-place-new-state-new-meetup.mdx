Well, as I was telling [Eric](http://www.wileymedia.com/weblog/ 'Eric Wiley') , I've officially moved. Sunny [Bloomington, Indiana](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bloomington,+IN,+USA&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1 'Bloomington, IN') is the city I now call home. Emily and I have mostly finished putting everything away and moving around our furniture (you really don't realize how much stuff you have until you have to move everything...), and now all that's left is hanging pictures and organizing shelves. Last week was a crazy, stressful one, but now I finally feel kind of settled in. Emily started orientation today at [IU](http://www.iu.edu/ 'Indiana University') , and I've been purposely trying to get lost in order to explore the city.

One unfortunate byproduct of the move was that it made me miss the [Cleveland Area Web Standards Meet-Up](http://webdesign.meetup.com/396/ 'The Cleveland Area Web Standards Meet Up Group') that was last week. I was hoping to make it, since I'm not sure when the next one I'll be able to attend is, seeing as though I'm now a good six hours away. I heard it was a good meetup though, and hopefully they'll only get better. Everyone's been doing a great job (especially Joseph James Frantz for organizing the whole deal), and it's just a very positive thing overall.

Speaking of Meetup groups, there aren't any like-minded meetups in the Bloomington/Indianapolis area, so as of today:

<div class="post_image_container">
  <p style="text-align: center">
    <a
      href="http://webstandards.meetup.com/129/"
      title="The Indianapolis/Bloomington Web Standards Meetup Group"
    >
      <img
        src="/images/meetupbadge.gif"
        alt="Bloomington/Indianapolis Wed Standards Meetup"
      />
    </a>
  </p>
</div>

We'll see what happens, but I'm excited.
