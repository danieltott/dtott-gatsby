  <p>Well, as I was telling <a href="http&#58;//www.wileymedia.com/weblog/" title="Eric Wiley">Eric</a>, I've officially moved.

Emily and I have mostly finished putting everything away and moving around our furniture (you really don't realize how much stuff you have until you have to move everything...), and now all that's left is hanging pictures and organizing shelves.  Last week was a crazy, stressful one, but now I finally feel kind of settled in.  Emily started orientation today at <a href="http&#58;//www.iu.edu/" title="Indiana University">IU</a>, and I've been purposely trying to get lost in order to explore the city.</p>

<p>Well, as I was telling <a href="http://www.wileymedia.com/weblog/" title="Eric Wiley">Eric</a>, I've officially moved.

<p>One unfortunate byproduct of the move was that it made me miss the <a href="http://webdesign.meetup.com/396/" title="The Cleveland Area Web Standards Meet Up Group">Cleveland Area Web Standards Meet-Up</a> that was last week.  I was hoping to make it, since I'm not sure when the next one I'll be able to attend is, seeing as though I'm now a good six hours away.  I heard it was a good meetup though, and hopefully they'll only get better.  Everyone's been doing a great job (especially Joseph James Frantz for organizing the whole deal), and it's just a very positive thing overall.</p>

<p>Speaking of Meetup groups, there aren't any like-minded meetups in the Bloomington/Indianapolis area, so as of today:</p>

<p>We'll see what happens, but I'm excited.</p>
