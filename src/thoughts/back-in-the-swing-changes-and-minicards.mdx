<p>Back from the trip. It was wonderful. Some catch-up news:</p>

<p>
  Inspired by{' '}

    Brad
  </a>{' '}
  and some whisperings in the back of my head, I made a few modifications to the
  layout of the site. Got rid of the welcome page (I'm not sure what I was
  thinking; I hate welcome pages with no content...), tossed the big buttons,
  and changed the header at the top to something more...pleasant. I also added
  headers for each main section.
</p>

<p>
  For the headers, I really wanted to use transparent PNGs, so that I wouldn't
  have to change all of them if I ever changed the background color. The problem
  with these is that IE 6 doesn't support them (surprise!). Unfourtunately, a
  decent amount of people still use IE6, so I can't just ignore it. Once again,
  Google saved the day. I found{' '}
  <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">an awesome little tool</a>{' '}
  that goes through and fixes them. You don't have to change anything in the
  HTML, and you choose which images it changes using normal CSS selectors. In
  conjunction with a little conditional comment magic, you can even keep it from
  messing up your stylesheets (and keep them valid!). As far as I can tell, it
  works on everything except tiled images and links. Booya!
</p>

<p>
  Another happy suprise on getting home was that my{' '}
  <a href="http://www.moo.com/products/minicards.php">Moo.com MiniCards</a>{' '}
  arrived. They look great, feel great, and at twenty bucks for a hundred, how
  can you miss?
