Back from the trip. It was wonderful. Some catch-up news:

Inspired by [Brad](http://www.braddielman.com/2007/07/31/a-little-nip-here-a-little-tuck-there/) and some whisperings in the back of my head, I made a few modifications to the layout of the site. Got rid of the welcome page (I'm not sure what I was thinking; I hate welcome pages with no content...), tossed the big buttons, and changed the header at the top to something more...pleasant. I also added headers for each main section.

For the headers, I really wanted to use transparent PNGs, so that I wouldn't have to change all of them if I ever changed the background color. The problem with these is that IE 6 doesn't support them (surprise!). Unfourtunately, a decent amount of people still use IE6, so I can't just ignore it. Once again, Google saved the day. I found [an awesome little tool](http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/) that goes through and fixes them. You don't have to change anything in the HTML, and you choose which images it changes using normal CSS selectors. In conjunction with a little conditional comment magic, you can even keep it from messing up your stylesheets (and keep them valid!). As far as I can tell, it works on everything except tiled images and links. Booya!

Another happy suprise on getting home was that my [Moo.com MiniCards](http://www.moo.com/products/minicards.php) arrived. They look great, feel great, and at twenty bucks for a hundred, how can you miss?
