This is maybe the fourth or fifth incarnation of dtott.com. This time around I tried to simplify everything, do away with (mostly) useless features, and concentrate on the reading experience. Here's some notes on the site. Hope you enjoy it!

## Craft

I had been kicking around a couple static-site generators (including [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the very cool [static.ly](http://static.ly/)), but I decided I really wanted the ability to add posts from other machines other than my own (like my iPad, for example). So, I decided to stick with a traditional CMS.

I really had been wanting to try out [Pixel & Tonic](http://pixelandtonic.com/)'s [new CMS, Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com/), and boy am I glad I did. Everything has been incredibly easy, from templating ( [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is the bomb diggity) to server setup and migration. One-click updating, even! It's been such a pleasure working with it, I can't wait to use it for client work.

## Sass, Grunt

I moved to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)/ [Compass](http://compass-style.org) from [Less](http://lesscss.org), which has overall been a positive experience. This site doesn't have too much going on in the way of complicated CSS aside from some relative unit trickiness (see below), but using Sass (and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for building) makes everything just a little easier and nicer.

## Webfonts by H&FJ

Type foundry Hoefler & Frere-Jones [recently released their own webfont service](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/) , which I jumped on as soon as I could. They make beautiful fonts, and their service includes a ton of nice tools. Currently this site is using [Gotham Narrow](http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/styles/) and [Whitney Pro](http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/styles/).

## Relative CSS Units: `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`

For browsers that support it, this site now makes full-use of [relative font-size units](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem) as well as viewport-relative font-size units. Using these together allows me to do some neat things when responding to different screen sizes. The font-size of everything is set to use rem, which means basically a percentage of whatever the font-size is of the html element. Then, I can set the html element's font-size in vw, which allows the entire site to respond to the width of the viewport! It's sort of fun stuff. Then all I have to do is set some breakpoints where things start looking a little funky. The only downside is that there is a webkit bug that prevents vw units from responding when a user drags their window around. So, I threw in a little javascript to help out with that.

Anyway, this has been a fun little project, and I'm looking forward to iterating on it and, hopefully, writing more. Thanks for checking it out!
