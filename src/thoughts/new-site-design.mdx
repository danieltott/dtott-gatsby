  This is maybe the fourth or fifth incarnation of dtott.com. This time around I
  tried to simplify everything, do away with (mostly) useless features, and
  concentrate on the reading experience. Here's some notes on the site. Hope you
  enjoy it!

<h2>Craft</h2>

<p>
  I had been kicking around a couple static-site generators (including{' '}
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the very cool{' '}
  <a href="http://static.ly/">static.ly</a>), but I decided I really wanted the
  ability to add posts from other machines other than my own (like my iPad, for
  example). So, I decided to stick with a traditional CMS.
</p>

<p>
  I really had been wanting to try out{' '}
  <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/">Pixel &amp; Tonic</a>'s{' '}
  <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/">new CMS, Craft</a>, and boy am I glad I
  did. Everything has been incredibly easy, from templating (
  <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">twig</a> is the bomb diggity) to server
  setup and migration. One-click updating, even! It's been such a pleasure
  working with it, I can't wait to use it for client work.
</p>

<h2>Sass, Grunt</h2>

<p>
  I moved to <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>/
  <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> from{' '}
  <a href="http://lesscss.org">Less</a>, which has overall been a positive
  experience. This site doesn't have too much going on in the way of complicated
  CSS aside from some relative unit trickiness (see below), but using Sass (and{' '}
  <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> for building) makes everything just a
  little easier and nicer.
</p>

<h2>Webfonts by H&amp;FJ</h2>
<p>
  Type foundry Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones{' '}
  <a href="http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/">
    recently released their own webfont service
  </a>
  , which I jumped on as soon as I could. They make beautiful fonts, and their
  service includes a ton of nice tools. Currently this site is using{' '}
  <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/styles/">Gotham Narrow</a> and{' '}
  <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/styles/">Whitney Pro</a>.
</p>

<h2>
  Relative CSS Units: <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>, and <code>vh</code>
</h2>

<p>
  For browsers that support it, this site now makes full-use of{' '}
  <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem">
    relative font-size units
  </a>{' '}
  as well as viewport-relative font-size units. Using these together allows me
  to do some neat things when responding to different screen sizes. The
  font-size of everything is set to use rem, which means basically a percentage
  of whatever the font-size is of the html element. Then, I can set the html
  element's font-size in vw, which allows the entire site to respond to the
  width of the viewport! It's sort of fun stuff. Then all I have to do is set
  some breakpoints where things start looking a little funky. The only downside
  is that there is a webkit bug that prevents vw units from responding when a
  user drags their window around. So, I threw in a little javascript to help out
  with that.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, this has been a fun little project, and I'm looking forward to
  iterating on it and, hopefully, writing more. Thanks for checking it out!
