  A new site, <a href="http://html5doctor.com">HTML5 Doctor</a> was recently
  released, and it promises to be a good resource for learning HTML5.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    We will publish articles relating to{' '}
    <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr>5 and it’s semantics and
    how to use them, here and now. We will also be inviting questions, in the
    form of <a href="http://html5doctor.com/ask-the-doctor">‘Ask the doctor’</a>{' '}
    to help answer people’s queries and questions. Answers will be posted in the
    form of articles for all to learn from.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  There are plenty of posts around describing all of the new elements, or
  discussing semantics of the new elements, but this site is nice in that it
  actually gives use-cases for each of them, so that you can learn the best way
  to use them on your next site.
