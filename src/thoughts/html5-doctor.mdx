A new site, [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com) was recently released, and it promises to be a good resource for learning HTML5.

> We will publish articles relating to <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr>5 and it’s semantics and how to use them, here and now. We will also be inviting questions, in the form of [‘Ask the doctor’](http://html5doctor.com/ask-the-doctor) to help answer people’s queries and questions. Answers will be posted in the form of articles for all to learn from.

There are plenty of posts around describing all of the new elements, or discussing semantics of the new elements, but this site is nice in that it actually gives use-cases for each of them, so that you can learn the best way to use them on your next site.

Bookmark this site, add it to your feed reader, and start HTML5-ing.
