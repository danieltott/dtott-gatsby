  Aside from browser bugs, float clearing can be one of the most frustrating
  aspects of CSS development. It takes a little bit of patience and thought to
  set up your floats and clears in a way that facilitates both your design and
  the flexibility required in a modern website.{' '}
</p>
<h3>The Old Way</h3>
<p>
  While judging the last contest of{' '}
  <a href="http://cssoff.com/" title="CSS Off">
    CSS Off
  </a>
  , one of the things that I found myself repeating over and over again was
  this: "Don't use empty <code>div</code>s to clear your floats!" What I meant
  by that was that in this day and age, there exist much better, more robust,
  and more semantically correct ways to properly clear floats that simply
  inserting{' '}
  <code>
    <div class="clear"></div>
  </code>
  .
</p>
<h3>The Not Really New Way</h3>
<p>
  Enter the{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html"
    title="Easy Clear on positioniseverything.net"
  >
    EasyClear method
  </a>
  . I'm calling this the "Not Really New Way" because it appeared on{' '}
  <a href="http://positioniseverything.net" title="positioniseverything.net">
    positioniseverything.net
  </a>{' '}
  in 2004, but is still being ignored for the old empty clear div solution.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  I'm not going to spend time explaining the specifics of <em>why</em> this
  solution works; they have gone over the technical aspects of the solution in
  the article, especially different hacks for different browsers. However,
  before I explain the best way to <em>use</em> the EasyClear on your sites,
  there is one part of CSS that needs to be understood, since the entire
  EasyClear method hinges on it: the <code>:after</code> pseudo-element.{' '}
</p>
<h3>
  <code>:after</code> - Intrigue and Deception
</h3>
<p>
  For a long time, I was confused about the <code>:after</code> pseudo-element.
  After doing a little testing and research, I figured it out. It's not all that
  difficult to understand, actually, but I was mislead in the beginning. The{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pseudo_after.asp"
    title=":after on w3schools.com"
  >
    w3schools.com's definition
  </a>{' '}
  of <code>:after</code> is the first that pops on on a quick{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.google.com/search?q=css+%3Aafter"
    title="Google: CSS :after"
  >
    Google search
  </a>
  , so it was the first place I went:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The :after pseudo-element inserts some content after an element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It turns out that this is <em>completely</em> incorrect. The{' '}
  <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#before-and-after"
    title=":after on w3.org"
  >
    actual definition
  </a>{' '}
  (via{' '}
  <a href="http://www.w3.org" title="W3">
    The W3
  </a>
  ) is this (emphasis added):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements can be used to insert generated
    content before or{' '}
    <strong>
      <em>after an element's content</em>
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The difference between the two definitions is considerable. Content inserted
  using the <code>:after</code> pseudo-element is inserted not after the
  element, but instead <em>within</em> the element and <em>after</em> the
  content. See an example{' '}
  <a
    href="http://dtott.com/examples/easyclear/after_example1.html"
    title=":after example"
  >
    here
  </a>
  .{' '}
</p>
<p>
  You can use <code>:after</code> to insert just about any content you'd like,
  and give it most CSS attributes, including <code>display</code> and{' '}
  <code>clear</code>. This is how EasyClear works its magic.
</p>
<h3>Using EasyClear</h3>
<p>
  Using EasyClear is simple. The only trick is to apply it to the correct
  element. The element that you are going to apply it to most is the element{' '}
  <em>containing</em> the floated elements. For example, a page with a container
  that has a background you'd like to extend to include the entire content, and
  two floated elements:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src="/examples/easyclear/example_page.png"
    alt="Example page"
    title="Example page"
  />
</p>
<p>
  In this example, you want to apply the EasyClear to <code>#container</code>,
  since that is the containing element. It will insert a block-level element
  with the <code>clear</code> attribute set to <code>both</code>, thus clearing
  the floats inside the element without crufting up your HTML. You can see an
  example at work{' '}
  <a
    href="http://dtott.com/examples/easyclear/easyclear_example.html"
    title="EasyClear example"
  >
    here
  </a>
  , and here's the EasyClear CSS itself:
</p>

```css
/* EasyClearing http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html */
#container:after {
  content: '.';
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
  visibility: hidden;
}

#container {
  display: inline-block;
}

/* Hides from IE-mac */
* html #container {
  height: 1%;
}

#container {
  display: block;
}
/* End hide from IE-mac */
```

<p>
  As you can see, it's pretty simple to employ, and the results are perfect. The
  best way that I've found to implement this on larger projects is to keep the
  EasyClear in one place, at the bottom of your main stylesheet, and simply add
  elements that you need to clear to the declaration itself, as illustrated{' '}
  <a
    href="http://dtott.com/examples/easyclear/easyclear_example2.html"
    title="EasyClear multiple-element example"
  >

  </a>
  .
