      About a year and a half ago, I had some ideas about using 3D CSS to create
      nonstandard 3D shapes, but never got around to writing a post about it.

      By stacking and rotating elements in 3D space, you can create some new
      shapes out of pure CSS. It's not practical or useful in the least, but it
      is interesting. These examples work best in Safari, but they will mostly
      work in Chrome. Check it out&#58;{' '}

<h2>What the heck is going on here?</h2>

<p>
  We&#8217;re basically stacking or rotating many elements to create each shape.
</p>
<h3>cylinder</h3>
<p>The jist of the cylinder code goes like this:</p>

```css
#cylinder div{
	border: 5px solid blue;
	-webkit-border-radius: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	width: 100px;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
}
#cylinder .slice-2{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(2px); }
#cylinder .slice-3{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(3px); }
#cylinder .slice-4{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(4px); }
#cylinder .slice-5{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(5px); }
#cylinder .slice-6{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(6px); }
#cylinder .slice-7{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(7px); }
#cylinder .slice-8{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(8px); }
#cylinder .slice-9{ -webkit-transform: translateZ(9px); }
...
```

<p>
  What we&#8217;re doing is setting all of the elements to the same 2D space,
  and then moving them along the Z-axis to create our cylinder.
</p>

<h3>Sphere(s)</h3>
<p>In the sphere (and watermelon), we take a different approach:</p>

```css
#sphere div{
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color:#900;
	border-style: solid;
	-webkit-border-radius: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	width: 100px;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	-webkit-transform-origin: center center 0;
}
.sphere .slice-0{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(0deg); }
.sphere .slice-1{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(1deg); }
.sphere .slice-2{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(2deg); }
.sphere .slice-3{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(3deg); }
.sphere .slice-4{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(4deg); }
.sphere .slice-5{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(5deg); }
.sphere .slice-6{ -webkit-transform: rotateY(6deg); }
...
```

<p>
  In this case, instead of stacking elements along the Z-axis, we&#8217;re
  rotating them 1 degree each along the Y-axis, thus getting ourselves a nice
  sphere.
</p>
<h2>But&#8230;why?</h2>
<p>
  Absolutely no reason. I haven&#8217;t thought of any practical application,
  and I doubt there really is any. But it was a good exercise to try to push 3D
  CSS to it&#8217;s limit, and it was fun. That&#8217;s reason enough, right
  there.
