      I know, I know. What this world really needs is a new rounded corners
      solution. With CSS3 support right around the corner (ha, right), why
      bother, right? Well, this solution offers something new to the world of
      rounded corners. What it does is this&#58; it crops the content below it,
      so that anything with a background color or image (headers, paragraphs,
      even images) automatically get the rounded corner treatment with no extra
      work. See below&#58;

  I know, I know. What this world really needs is a new rounded corners
  solution. With CSS3 support right around the corner (ha, right), why bother,
  right?
</p>

<p>
  Well, this solution offers something new to the world of rounded corners. What
  it does is this: it crops the content below it, so that anything with a
  background color or image (headers, paragraphs, even images) automatically get
  the rounded corner treatment with no extra work. See below:
</p>

<p>
  <img
    src="/examples/croppingcorners/images/screenshot.jpg"
    alt="Screenshot of cropping corners"
    style="width:49em;"
  />
</p>

<p>
  In this screenshot, the image is a normal, rectangular image. Nothing was done
  to it, except inserting it inside one of my rounded corners containers. It's
  easy enough that you can even have your clients do it in their{' '}
  <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>s without the headache of
  trying to teach them to use the Rounded Rectangle Tool in Photoshop.
</p>

<p>
  This technique solves a very specific issue. There are plenty of ways to
  render rounded corners that involve less markup, simpler CSS, and less time in
  photoshop, but none of them (that I am aware of) crop the content below it.
</p>

<p>
  You can view the solution at work{' '}
  <a
    href="http://dtott.com/examples/croppingcorners/index.html"
    title="Cropping Corners Example"
  >
    here
  </a>
  , and I'll try to take you through how it works.
</p>

<h3>First, The Images</h3>

<p>
  So this part isn't too hard, as long as you can navigate your way around
  photoshop. Just as a note, it's definitely possible that there are better ways
  to go about this part in photoshop. If there are, don't hesitate to drop a
  line in the comments.
</p>

<p>
  First things first: go and download the{' '}
  <a href="http://www.fnordware.com/superpng/" title="Super PNG">
    Super PNG
  </a>{' '}
  plug-in for photoshop. What this plug-in does is strips out the color
  information that photoshop usually saves with PNGs, which will help you avoid
  that little difference you can see between browsers. See{' '}
  <a
    href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/png-gamma/"
    title="The Sad Story of PNG Gamma Correction"
  >
    here
  </a>{' '}
  for a more detailed explanation, but this is important.{' '}
</p>

<p>
  {' '}
  Once you've got Super PNG running, use the aforementioned Rounded Rectangle
  Tool to create a rounded rectangle with your desired radius and give it the
  background color of your container. Edit the layer style to give it a stroke
  of whatever width you'd like, then rastersize it. Then, decide how much
  padding you want to be cropped inside your container (I used 2 pixels in the
  screenshot above). Duplicate your rectangle, and shrink it to fit inside of
  your desired padding. CMD/CTRL+click on the layer thumbnail to load the
  selection on the smaller rectangle, then select the larger rectangle and hit
  delete. You can now throw out the smaller rectangle.
</p>

<p>
  Once this is done, you should have the outline of a container. Now, zoom in to
  one of the corners, and, using the marque tool, select a square that is just
  big enough to contain the corner. Copy it, open a new document, and paste it
  in. Throw out the background, if there is one, and you should have a corner
  that looks something like this:
</p>

<p>
  <img
    src="/examples/croppingcorners/images/borderscreenshot.jpg"
    title="The top-left border at %1200"
  />
</p>

<p>
  Once you've got this, simply save it, then rotate it and save it three more
  times so that you end up with each corner.
</p>

<h3>Second, The HTML</h3>

<p>
  Now that that annoying photoshop work is done, I'm going to start referring
  you to an actual example, located here. Here's the HTML for one box:{' '}
</p>

```html
<div class="b_greyWhiteStroke">
  <div class="TL"></div>
  <div class="BL"></div>
  <div class="TR"></div>
  <div class="BR"></div>
  <div class="b_innerContainer">
    <h2>This Is A Block</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

<p>
  This is fairly simple. There's a div for the outer container, a{' '}
  <code>div</code> for the inner container, and a <code>div</code> for each
  border. All of your content will go inside <code>.b_innerContainer</code>, and
  the corners of this content will automatically be cropped.
</p>

<h3>Third, The CSS</h3>

<p>
  The CSS for this solution is a little more complicated, but nothing too bad.
  The basic idea is that you give the border <code>div</code>s{' '}
  <code>position:absolute</code>, place them in the corners, and let them sit on
  top of everything else, thus cropping it:
</p>

```css
.b_greyWhiteStroke {
  position: relative;
  border-color: #dce3e7;
}

.TL,
.BL,
.TR,
.BR {
  width: 6px;
  height: 6px;
  position: absolute;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: transparent;
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}

.TL {
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
.BL {
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
}
.TR {
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}
.BR {
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

.b_greyWhiteStroke .TL {
  background-image: url(images/grey_whitestroke_tl.png);
}
.b_greyWhiteStroke .BL {
  background-image: url(images/grey_whitestroke_bl.png);
}
.b_greyWhiteStroke .TR {
  background-image: url(images/grey_whitestroke_tr.png);
}
.b_greyWhiteStroke .BR {
  background-image: url(images/grey_whitestroke_br.png);
}

.b_innerContainer {
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 2px 2px 8px;
}

.b_greyWhiteStroke .b_innerContainer {
  border-color: #dce3e7;
}
```

<p>
  See, that's not too bad, is it? A couple notes here. First, I've separated{' '}
  <code>.TR</code> from <code>.b_greyWhiteStroke .TR</code>. This is so that I
  can have multiple background-color schemes going with only minor additions to
  the CSS. So, if i wanted to create, say, and alert box with a yellow border, I
  wouldn't have to rewrite all the existing CSS, I'd just have to make some
  additions.
</p>

<h3>
  What about <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">ie6</abbr>?
</h3>

<p>
  <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">Ie6</abbr>, as always, was the big headache
  here. However, by hacking up{' '}
  <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com">Angus Turnbull</a>'s{' '}
  <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">IE PNG Fix</a> with a couple
  of my own modifications, I managed to get it to work. The problem, aside from{' '}
  <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">ie6</abbr>'s refusal to run transparent
  PNGs, was that the border block wouldn't always line up with the edge of the
  container. I assume it's some sort of rounding error, but I'm not positive
  about that. Anyway, the PNG Fix now fixes the transparency, and checks to make
  sure the borders are where they should be. The only problem here is that this
  solution doesn't work in <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">ie6</abbr> when you
  use a fluid width. Or, more correctly, it will correct itself when the page
  loads, but there is a possibility of the borders moving a pixel out of place
  if user starts manually changing the width of the window. Check out{' '}
  <a
    href="http://dtott.com/examples/croppingcorners/index.html"
    title="Cropping Corners Example"
  >
    the example page
  </a>{' '}
  in <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">ie6</abbr> to see what i mean. Here is
  the code to include this fix:
</p>

```html
&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]&gt; &lt;style type="text/css"&gt; .TL, .BL, .TR, .BR{
overflow: hidden; behavior: url("ie6fixborders.htc"); } &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
```

<h3>The End</h3>
<p>
  So, there you have it. You can download the entire example{' '}
  <a
    href="/examples/croppingcorners/croppingCorners.zip"
    title="Cropping Corners .zip file"
  >
    here
  </a>
  . This solution, for sure, is not the best for all situations. There are tons
  of smaller and easier solutions out there, and you should use them unless you
  have this specific need. However, if you do decide you need something like
  this, I think you'll find it to your liking.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  As always, I'm more than open for comments and suggestions for improvement.
  Hopefully you'll find this solution useful sometime in the future.{' '}
