    title="CSS Off - Meet The Judges"

    I was one of the judges
  </a>{' '}
  for this month's contest. Judging was a very rewarding process for me. It's
  one thing to sneer at someone's code and talk about Standards and best
  practice and everything, but it's an entirely different thing to have to back
  it up with reasons. I also strived, when I could, to offer suggestions on how
  to fix something, instead of just pointing out that it was wrong. It was a
  very fun experience, and I'm looking forward to helping out on next month's
  CSS Off.
</p>
<p>
  Again, congratulations, Brad! Cleveland repre<em>sent</em>!
