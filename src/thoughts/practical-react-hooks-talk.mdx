In my [hooks talk for the Cleveland React Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-React/events/261043210/) , I live-coded a conversion from a class-based app to one using [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). I have published [the code from the talk on GitHub](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk) .

This repo has branches containing each step along the way, from the [basic class-based app](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/tree/00-base) to the [completed thing](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/tree/06-Bonus-UserFilterContext) .

I created Pull Requests detailing each step, to make it easy to see diffs along the way. Each pull request has notes on the specific steps taken:

- [Step 1 - Convert Filter component](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/5)
- [Step 2 - Convert SelectUsers component](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/6)
- [Step 3 - Create useLoad custom hook and integrate into App component](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/7)
- [Step 4 - Convert Todos component](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/8)
- [Bonus Step 5 - Move api client into Context](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/9)
- [Bonus Step 6 - Create a UserFilter Context and Custom Hook](https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/10)

Feel free to leave comments or questions in issues or the PRs - would be happy to discuss anything!

It was a pleasure to deliver this talk and kick off a new meetup. I definitely learned some things along the way - and perhaps some things I'd do differently were I to give this talk again. But, I think overall it was a success!
