<p>In my <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-React/events/261043210/">hooks talk for the Cleveland React Meetup</a>, I live-coded a conversion from a class-based app to one using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a>. I have published <a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk">the code from the talk on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This repo has branches containing each step along the way, from the <a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/tree/00-base">basic class-based app</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/tree/06-Bonus-UserFilterContext">completed thing</a>.</p>
<p>I created Pull Requests detailing each step, to make it easy to see diffs along the way. Each pull request has notes on the specific steps taken:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/5">Step 1 - Convert Filter component</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/6">Step 2 - Convert SelectUsers component</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/7">Step 3 - Create useLoad custom hook and integrate into App component</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/8">Step 4 - Convert Todos component</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/9">Bonus Step 5 - Move api client into Context</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danieltott/practicalHooksTalk/pull/10">Bonus Step 6 - Create a UserFilter Context and Custom Hook</a></li>
</ul><p>Feel free to leave comments or questions in issues or the PRs - would be happy to discuss anything!</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to deliver this talk and kick off a new meetup. I definitely learned some things along the way - and perhaps some things I'd do differently were I to give this talk again. But, I think overall it was a success!<br /></p>
