<p>Here's a screenshot of my site in a Firefox tab with my original favicon:</p>

<div class="post_image_container">
  <p>
    <img src="/images/favicon_old.jpg" alt="Old Favicon" />
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  As you can see, it looks fine in the location bar, but you can see the white
  square of the favicon on the tabs (especially when a tab is not selected).
  Here's the new version:
</p>

<div class="post_image_container">
  <p>
    <img src="/images/favicon_new.jpg" alt="New Favicon" />
  </p>
</div>

<p>Much better! Want to know how to do it?</p>
