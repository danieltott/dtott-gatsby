There's [a great collection of IE6 fixes](http://www.virtuosimedia.com/tutorials/ultimate-ie6-cheatsheet-how-to-fix-25-internet-explorer-6-bugs#javascript-detection) up on [Virtuosi Media](http://www.virtuosimedia.com/) that is worth a bookmark. If you've ever stepped into IE6 (and, chances are, you have) you know that it can be a mess. This cheatsheet is a very nice roundup of IE6 bugs in HTML/CSS/Javascript, plus a few more goodies.

None of this information is new at all, but it's very nice having it all in one place, and you can just have one bookmark for IE6 fixes instead of an entire folder full of them(:
