There are no good desktop Twitter apps out there. I seriously can't stand any of them. So this is a plea to the software developers out there: Please, make a good one. To get you started, here's a list of features I'd like to see:

### Not Adobe AIR

Please, just don't bother. There's a ton, and they all suck. You know what else? They might have a chance at being decent if they weren't in AIR. It just isn't very good.

### Standard OS X chrome/behaviors

I'd like it to look like a Mac app. Why Twitterific looks/behaves like an Adobe AIR (cr)app, I'll never understand.

### Multiple Accounts

This one's a must. Twhirl does this ok, but I think there could be better ways of dealing with it.

### Filter hashtags

I'd like to be able to filter things out, or highlight especially interesting tags. Especially useful during events that I can't go to / don't care about.

### Searching

Both searching the tweets you have cached, and also easy access to [search.twitter](http://search.twitter.com).

### The standard stuff

There are plenty of things that apps like Twitterific, Twhirl, and the like do well. Easy replies, easy previewing of other peoples @replies, easy linking to whichever url-shortening service i desire, an option to automatically expand the urls when I'm viewing them, etc, etc.

I know it's possible. Tweetie, for the iPhone, comes close. It handles multiple accounts well, and really, it does a lot of things very well. Too bad it only comes for the iPhone.
