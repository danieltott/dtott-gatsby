  There are no good desktop Twitter apps out there. I seriously can't stand any
  of them. So this is a plea to the software developers out there: Please, make
  a good one. To get you started, here's a list of features I'd like to see:
</p>
<h3>Not Adobe AIR</h3>
<p>
  Please, just don't bother. There's a ton, and they all suck. You know what
  else? They might have a chance at being decent if they weren't in AIR. It just
  isn't very good.
</p>
<h3>Standard OS X chrome/behaviors</h3>
<p>
  I'd like it to look like a Mac app. Why Twitterific looks/behaves like an
  Adobe AIR (cr)app, I'll never understand.
</p>
<h3>Multiple Accounts</h3>
<p>
  This one's a must. Twhirl does this ok, but I think there could be better ways
  of dealing with it.
</p>
<h3>Filter hashtags</h3>
<p>
  I'd like to be able to filter things out, or highlight especially interesting
  tags. Especially useful during events that I can't go to / don't care about.
</p>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
  Both searching the tweets you have cached, and also easy access to{' '}
  <a href="http://search.twitter.com">search.twitter</a>.
</p>
<h3>The standard stuff</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of things that apps like Twitterific, Twhirl, and the like do
  well. Easy replies, easy previewing of other peoples @replies, easy linking to
  whichever url-shortening service i desire, an option to automatically expand
  the urls when I'm viewing them, etc, etc.
</p>
<p>
  I know it's possible. Tweetie, for the iPhone, comes close. It handles
  multiple accounts well, and really, it does a lot of things very well. Too bad
  it only comes for the iPhone.{' '}
