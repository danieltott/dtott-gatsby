I recently gave a talk at our [Cleveland React meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-React) about [different ways to style React components](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-React/events/268063093). I thought it'd be cool to share both the slides as well as the example code for the talk.

You can [view the slides on Netlify](https://clereact-styling-react-components-slides.netlify.com), and the [source code over on Github](https://github.com/danieltott/styling-react-components-slides). I used a package called [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) which was an awesome experience. mxd-deck allows you to code a slide deck using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), which is a combination of Markdown and JSX. It uses Gatsby behind the scenes, which means it builds out as a static site that can be easily hosted on Netlify!

In the talk, I examined styling components using the `style` prop, different ways of using real CSS, and then a couple different CSS-in-JS approaches, including [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com).

The code examples are also [up on Github](https://github.com/danieltott/Styling-React-Components). Each one has it's own build on Netlify and can be toyed with on CodeSandbox. The modern internet is pretty cool.

Thanks to everyone who came and listened to me babble. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
